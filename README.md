# Processes Scheduling Analysis

> comparison and contrast

The purpose of this project is to analyze and compare these different algorithms, to show their strengths and weaknesses, and to visualize them.

What was initially a thesis, became a hobby... oh well.

### Motivation

The motivation of this topic is due to my overwhelming interest in scheduling algorithms. It's a deep and complex topic that can be explored and serve as a great academic exercise.

Although there are a lot of algorithms to cover and time is scarce, at least the more complex and interesting ones can be tackled and implemented.

## Dependencies

`curses`

## How to run

```bash
# get code
git clone https://github.com/Anarcroth/process-scheduling-analysis.git

# go to source
cd process-scheduling-analysis/src

# compile
make

# run
./psa.app
```

**NOTE:** Run in full-screen, because the `curses` graphics are hard-coded (due to the lack of time to fix it)

### Contributions

All are welcomed!
