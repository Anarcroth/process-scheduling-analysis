PJF is a dynamic scheduling algorithm used in
real-time operating systems to place processes
in a priority queue.

Whenever a scheduling event occurs (a task
finishes, new task is released, etc.), the queue
will be searched for the process closest to its
deadline, which will be the next to be scheduled
for execution.
