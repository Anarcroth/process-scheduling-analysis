First Come First Served (FCFS), is the simplest
scheduling algorithm.
FCFS simply queues processes in the order that
they arrive in the ready queue.
This is commonly used for a task queue.

Since context switches only occur upon process
termination, and no reorganization of the process
queue is required, scheduling overhead is minimal.

Throughput can be low, because long processes can
be holding CPU, waiting the short processes for a
long time (known as convoy effect).

No starvation, because each process gets chance to
be executed after a definite time.

Turnaround time, waiting time and response time
depends on the order of their arrival and can be
high for the same reasons above.

No prioritization occurs, thus this system has
trouble meeting process deadlines.
