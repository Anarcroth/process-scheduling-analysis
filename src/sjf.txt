With this strategy the scheduler arranges processes
with the least estimated processing time remaining
to be next in the queue. This requires advanced
knowledge or estimations about the time required for
a process to complete.

If a shorter process arrives during another process's
execution, the currently running process is
interrupted, dividing that process into two separate
computing blocks.

This algorithm is designed for maximum throughput in
most scenarios.

Waiting time and response time increase as the
process's computational requirements increase. Since
turnaround time is based on waiting time plus
processing time, longer processes are significantly
affected by this.

Starvation is possible, especially in a busy system
with many small processes being run.

To use this policy we should have at least two
processes of different priority.
