The scheduler assigns a fixed time unit per process,
and cycles through them. If process completes within
that time-slice it gets terminated otherwise it is
rescheduled after giving a chance to other processes.

RR scheduling involves extensive overhead, especially
with a small time unit.

Balanced throughput between FCFS/ FIFO and SJF/SRTF,
shorter jobs are completed faster than in FIFO and
longer processes are completed faster than in SJF.

Good average response time, waiting time is dependent
on number of processes, and not average
process length.

Because of high waiting times, deadlines are rarely
met in a pure RR system.

Starvation can never occur, since no priority is
given. Order of time unit allocation is based upon
process arrival time, similar to FIFO.
