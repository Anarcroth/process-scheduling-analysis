CFS is a process scheduler which was merged into
the 2.6.23 (October 2007) release of the Linux
kernel and is the default scheduler. It handles CPU
resource allocation for executing processes, and aims
to maximize overall CPU utilization while also
maximizing interactive performance.

The data structure used for the scheduling algorithm
is a red-black tree in which the nodes are scheduler
-specific sched_entity structures. These are derived
from the general task_struct process descriptor, with
added scheduler elements.

The nodes are indexed by processor "execution time" in
nanoseconds.

A "maximum execution time" is also calculated for each
process. This time is based upon the idea that an
"ideal processor" would equally share processing power
amongst all processes. Thus, the maximum execution
time is the time the process has been waiting to run,
divided by the total number of processes, or in other
words, the maximum execution time is the time the
process would have expected to run on an
"ideal processor".
